          <div class="about">
            I really enjoy solving things. Web development has been a blessing for me,
            and something that I have been looking for since I graduated college.
            Javascript and Ruby are something I really enjoy, as well as algorithmic
            building. There is still so much to learn, and I am eager to do so. While at GA,
            building projects has been incredibly interesting and rewarding. The logic based
            interactions and webbings are something I find fascinating, and want to pursue.
            Below you will find the projects I have worked on in my time at GA,
            and hope to build off of in the future. With such an eclectic background,
            I am happy to finally found something I'm ready to dive headfirst into
            and continually learn and develop my skills. I am very big on functionality,
            my aesthetic skills leave a lot to be desired, but I am open to doing anything
            and everything related to software/web development!

          <p>My First Project, Tic-tac-toe, really allowed me to get a handle on html, css, javascript,
          and jquery for making api requests. I was very unfamiliar with most everything, but especially the interaction
          between back and front end, aka API requests. This project helped me a lot in giving me a basis of making
          such requests, as well as getting familiar with logic and implementation of such based on
          what I'm trying to accomplish. In this case, the logic was test every time a new target was clicked to every
          winning order, or ending game and having it being a tie when appropriate. I really enjoyed building
          the logic portion, and understanding jquery and ajax.</p>

          <p>My Second Project, Book Clubs, immersed me in the backend part of things, where we had to develop
          a working back and front end that communicated with each other and stored data in a
          relational database. It also furthered my skills in html, css, javascript, jquery,
          and ajax. Understanding the innerworkings of databases and their interactions is a difficult process,
          and this project allowed me to see what things can and should be in the back end, versus
          the goal of the front end and what you should be included there instead of the back end, or not.
          This was my first interaction with back end/fullstack, and it was a great way to help
          my knowledge of fullstack development with relational databases, and manipulation of them.</p>

          <p>This was a group project that I am very proud of making with my classmates.
            We did a lot of planning and strategizing, which ended up being very important
            in the implementation process. We did a lot of pair programming, and when we were
            done with a certain feature, we would all decide what we wanted to do next and how
            we were going to execute it. I found it very valuable to work with others and bounce
            ideas off each other and work together to create something awesome. We were able to
            create user authentication features, with their own blogs, and their own comments on
            any blogs. We were also able to add a 'like' button so users could like blogs. We
            sort the blogs by number of likes tied to amount of time since blog post, where newer
            blogs with the a certain number of likes will be higher up than older blogs with the
            same number of likes. We also contrived a search by blog titles, blog bodies, and user
            handles to see blogs matching those fields. As a team, through effective planning and
            strategizing, were able to implement a lot of features in not a lot of time, something
            I am proud of as a team member. </p>

            <p>For my final project, I built a full stack guessing number game. I used react in the
              front end and ruby on rails in the back end. I found I really enjoy working with react.
              It is awesome to be able to split routes and render whatever you want for each with ease.
              React is great for organization and using component templates/forms, which I really like.
              Through this, I was able to implement two different game types, each with their own back
              end route and schema. One game involves guessing three digit number, and the other
              a four digit number. I was able to set up links and routes using react, and easily
              rendered them how I liked for each. I would definitely like to work with react on future
              projects. As for rails, I was able to get a lot more comfortable working with it and managing
              my migrations and schema. I look forward to continued learning in this particular stack.</p>
